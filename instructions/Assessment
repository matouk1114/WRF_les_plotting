Two week assessment period for New Hires

The period from the 25th of July to the 5th of August will be used to assess if New 
Hire has the requisite competencies to contribute to funded projects within the 
Atmospheric Science and Climate Research program area of EVS. 


The three areas of fundamental importance are:
* The ability to write clear, concise well documented and self documented code.
* The understanding of version control and practicing good use of version control systems. 
* The ability to understand simple mathematical concepts and code these up appropriately. 

To assess these competencies a simple task must be performed within the alloted
time period. Performance will be assessed on submission of code, via a series of Pull
Requests to a GitHub repository. 

The task is to visualize simulation data produced by the Weather Research and
Forecasting Large Eddy Simulation (WRF-LES) model. Data will be provided and the
deliverable will be in the form of a .py file that can be run on the command
line:

plot_wrf.py /path/to/input_file.nc /path/to/output/ Variable Level vmim=vmin vmax=vmax

Variable: the NetCDF variable to plot
Level: level, in height, to plot 
vmin, vmax: ranges of values to plot. Optional keyword arguments, defaults to
range of values available

Some assumptions to be made:
The grid spacing in the horizontal is 100m
The grid spacing in the vertical is 40m, and the origin is at 0m

The python script will
* Use xarray [1] or NetCDF4pytyhon to read in the data
* Use Matplotlib to plot the data using pcolormesh
* Use Numpy to calculate the grid mean, minimum and maximum values of the variable
* Use Numpy to calculate the mean of the variable as a function of height.
* Write these values out to a text file
* Save plot to a png file

The repository to start from is here:
https://github.com/EVS-ATMOS/WRF_les_plotting

You will be required to use the git command line tool, no "web based" commits.
Please use clear commit messages and submit your work as at least *two* pull requests:
One for basic plotting and one for the grid statistics. As per the competencies
we are looking for code must be: 
* Well documented and self documenting. This includes good docstrings 
 (look at any of the major code in Py-ART for good examples).
* In-so-far as possible PEP8 complaint [3]
* Is developed using test driven design [4]. While we are not expecting 
 Unit Tests, you should start with code that, as a minimum, produces an image and, 
 incrementally improve it by testing it to breaking point. Please make use of exception 
 handling.. see for example [5]

You will be assessed on 
* Completion of the task
* Coding style and practice
* Good commit messages and version control practice (see [6])
